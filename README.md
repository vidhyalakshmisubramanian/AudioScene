# AudioScene
AudioScene – Image to Audio Description System Built an assistive AI system that generates accurate image captions using pretrained vision–language models and converts them into natural speech for accessibility applications. It is designed to help visually impaired users understand visual scenes using image captioning and text-to-speech technology.

## 🔹 Features
- User image upload
- High-quality image captions using pretrained BLIP
- Natural audio narration (Text-to-Speech)
- Runs entirely in Google Colab

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Transformers (BLIP)
- gTTS (Text-to-Speech)
- Google Colab

## 🔹 How It Works
1. User uploads an image
2. The system generates a descriptive caption
3. The caption is converted into speech
4. Audio output is played to the user

## 🔹 How to Run (Colab)
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Install dependencies
3. Upload an image
4. Listen to the generated audio description

## 🔹 Use Cases
- Assistive technology for visually impaired users
- Accessibility-focused AI applications
- Computer vision + audio projects

## 🔹 Future Enhancements
- Distance and obstacle detection
- Real-time camera input
- Multi-language audio support
